// MARK: - Plan BQ P3 — camera App Schema adoption
//
// OpenGlasses is a camera app; adopting the camera schema gives its glasses capture the
// pre-trained Siri phrasing ("start recording", "take a photo") instead of relying on our
// own App Shortcut phrase list. The `@AppIntent(schema:)` macro supplies title/description
// and the appintentsmetadataprocessor validates the shape at build time — the Release pass
// is the gate. (The iOS 18 `@AssistantIntent(schema:)` spelling is deprecated in the
// current SDK; `camera.startCapture` requires `captureMode`/`timerDuration`/`device`.)

/// What the glasses capture — the schema's CaptureMode, with this app's two real modes.
