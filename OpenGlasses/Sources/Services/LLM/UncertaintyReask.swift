/// final?" is a useless literal search query — no tournament, no sport — and a grounding prompt
/// that never shows the model what was already said can't reconcile the new results with its
/// earlier (possibly incomplete) answer. So: context-dependent questions are first rewritten
/// into a self-contained query via the caller's model, and the grounding prompt carries the
/// recent exchanges.

/// The transparency prefix means a re-grounded answer is never silently swapped in for the
/// model's own — consistent with the project's no-silent-fallback stance.
